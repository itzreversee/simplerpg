### Version Unstable
To open the launcher, run ```python3 launcher.py``` in your terminal!  
Remember that this is unstable branch! Stuff might break!!

### Branches
 * unstable - not so stable, but playable ( i think ) ( THIS ONE )
 * stable - Most stable branch, it is where the release are made!
 * edge - don't touch that! it is broken all the time - **NOT CREATED YET** 
 * *test - eg. villagetest, it is testing branch for some major things that aparently need entirely diffrent code, and then i will have trouble merging it into unstable...
